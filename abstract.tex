%Biometric authentication offers improved usability over traditional passcode-based authentication, but security-conscious users may differ from non-expert everyday users in their willingness to adopt new methods of unlocking. 
 %\todo{Flynn, you need to say here why particularly these two groups (i.e., that experts are rarely considered in the design process)} 

% paucity of research in authentication, not necessarily experts. Haven't looked at adoption rate

% use term security-conscious
  
  
We report on a qualitative inquiry among security-expert and non-expert mobile device users about the adoption of biometric authentication using semi-structured interviews (n=38, 19/19 expert/non-expert).  Both groups harbored misconceptions, such as misunderstanding of biometric's functional role in authentication and were about equally likely to have stopped using biometrics due to usability (36.8\%/26.3\% experts/non-experts). Security experts more readily adopted biometrics than non-experts but also harbored greater distrust towards its use for sensitive transactions at a rate of 5:1. These findings suggest the need for tailored training to both match concerns of each group and address the apparent misconceptions.  Refinement of these features would remove perceived obstacles to ubiquitous computing among the growing population of mobile technology users sensitized to security risk.
